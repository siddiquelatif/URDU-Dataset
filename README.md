# URDU-Dataset
URDU dataset contains emotional utterances of Urdu speech gathered from Urdu talk shows. It contains 400 utterances of four basic emotions: Angry, Happy, Neutral, and Emotion. There are 38 speakers (27 male and 11 female).

This data is created from Youtube. Speakers are selected randomly. Anyone can use this data only for research purposes. 
Nomenclature followed while naming the files in the dataset is to provide information about the speaker, gender, number of the file for that speaker and overall numbering of the file in particular emotion. Files are named as follows:

General Name: SGX_FXX_EYY 

The name can be divided into three segments which is segregated by underscore(_) sign. 

Where, 

In SGX, G indicates the gender of the speaker either it can be M for male speaker and F for female speaker, while X represents the speaker ID which remains the same for a particular speaker in all the emotions. 

In FXX, F is a keyword presenting file and XX indicates the number of file for particular speaker. 

In EYY, E provides the information about emotion i.e., A,H,N and S for Angery, Happy, Neutral and Sad. respectively. 

For example, file name SM1_F01_A12 indicates that this is 1st file recorded by speaker No. 1 and A12 indicates that this is 12th file of angery emotion.
